This web app works is for the students of jamia millia islamia.
This app has three methods for calculating the percentage from CPI for different courses and school.These methods are as mentioned below
1.for BTECH (cubic formula)
2.For other university courses (Linear Formula)
3.For Jamia school 
A student can choose any of the above methods corresponding to his/her course to get the equivalent percentage from CPI/CGPA/SGPA as these three methods/modes use three different mathematical formulas to calculate the equivalent percenntage.

1. For BTECH and related courses

The formula used for calculating equivalent percentage is 

%= (20*y*y*y - 380*y*y + 2725*y - 1690)/84

where y is your CPI/CGPA/SGPA.

2. For other courses

This formula is used for students of courses like M.SC, M.PHIL etc

The formula used for calculating equivalent percentage is 

%= (y-0.5)*10

where y is your CPI/CGPA/SGPA.

3. For jamia school

This formula is used for students of Jamia school

The formula used for calculating equivalent percentage is 

%= y*(9.5)

where y is your CPI/CGPA/SGPA.
