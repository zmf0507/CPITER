# CPITER
[CPITER](https://zmf.000webhostapp.com/cpiter) is a simple web app to convert your sgpa/cgpa/cpi to percentage.

This web app is developed for the students of [Jamia Millia Islamia](http://jmi.ac.in).
This app has three methods for calculating the percentage from CPI for different courses and school.These methods are as mentioned below:
1. For BTECH (cubic formula)
2. For other university courses (Linear Formula)
3. For Jamia school 
A student can choose any of the above methods corresponding to his/her course to get the equivalent percentage from CPI/CGPA/SGPA as these three methods/modes use three different mathematical formulas to calculate the equivalent percenntage.

## 1. For BTECH and related courses

The formula used for calculating equivalent percentage is 

```
%= (20*y*y*y - 380*y*y + 2725*y - 1690)/84
```

where y is your CPI/CGPA/SGPA.

## 2. For other courses

This formula is used for students of courses like M.SC, M.PHIL etc

The formula used for calculating equivalent percentage is 

```
%= (y-0.5)*10
```

where y is your CPI/CGPA/SGPA.

## 3. For jamia school

This formula is used for students of Jamia school

The formula used for calculating equivalent percentage is 

```
%= y*(9.5)
```

where ```y``` is your CPI/CGPA/SGPA.
